## General Meeting Notes

- Information about clients:
    - Husband and wife
    - Truji is a registered business - Digital identity product is the end product
    - Meetings with clients will occur every week, Wednesday 3-4pm
    - Clients want us to "project manage them", to send them milestones and information
- Information about project:
    - Reference website: Fresha
    - "Happy hour" service is the unique offering of You Beauty. Lower prices will fall on certain hours of the day (when not as busy), and help salons to utilise their time better
        - Look at analysing data to have recommended happy hours
    - Must include options to choose: service wanted, location/area and time
    - Implementing from scratch, from specifications
    - Need a way to capture registrations
    - Possible (optional) further developments:
        - Look at a salon's booking history and use for a predictive algorithm when determining happy hour time
        - Price matching, AI
        - Co-pilot feature
        - Photo feature, upload with advice for hairstyling, using AI
        - Chatbot feature
    - Use ChatGPT to generate sample (fake) datasets
    - Let the clients know about hosting options with pricing estimates
    - Let the clients know about any costs for tools needed
    - No specific requirements for programming languages used
    - Needs to be functional across different devices (mobile, desktop etc.)
    - Success criteria: 
        - Book + make appointments based on their availability + for the services to go online with times, services and happy hour.
        - Includes the unique offering of You Beauty against competitors (happy hour). Clients hope that it would be taken to a salon and they would be convinced to sign up.
